MemoryBanks:
	In us humans, it to me feels like our experience-memories are actually just associations of one thing with another.
	So for example, the word car to us is associated with a mental image of a car. Which we then can link with the
	word 4 wheels. Or any other car identification wording. So what I think I need to do is to come up with something
	similar. I need a storage medium representing kind of a mind map. One main subject, and many sub-subjects. 
	If the subject is car, we want it the ai to be able to add information about cars when given, and if the user
	presents similar information, but a bit different, then we want the ai to express doubt and ask if the user is 
	certain.

	"is a" can be a special word used to link two things together. For example, a user input of "Hello is a greeting"
	would tell the program to create a new memory bank for "greeting", and add "hello" to the group of "implemnters"

	"has a" or "have a" would be similar but instead of adding the word to the group, it would add it as a criteria
	for implementers in the group. Kind of like a interface.

	Seeing this, it more feels like experience-memory is actually just a lot of interfaces. When we think of a object,
	we already have a preset "interface" that defines what we expect that type of oject will have or contain.

	
	
Hear thought:
	We probably want to split up the sentances we hear into individual keywords, and maybe even throw away words with
	low value.
